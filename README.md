## MVP

The MVP is a very limited initial version of the Charity Dapp. The goal is to create the bare minimum that is needed to start funding projects, it will not be until Phase 2 and 3 where utility will come into the system (being able to fund and unfund milestone based smart contracts and allowing the Donors to give the project they are funding feedback). The MVP will be completely centralized, will desperately need a UI and will not have many advantages to currently running projects like GoFundMe, but it will evolve from here, this is still the early stages, the actual development only started in late October!
